# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

 Python application to improve the experience for patients who need high-cost medications. The application should scrape a government website and use LLM to provide a more user-friendly interface.


## Current State

- Empty repository with only `.claude/settings.local.json` configuration
- No package.json, source files, or development tools configured yet
- No established architecture or development patterns to follow

## Development Commands

Develop an application that:

Scrapes the page https://www.saude.df.gov.br/protocolos-clinicos-ter-resumos-e-formularios
Extracts the list of clinical conditions served by CEAF (Specialized Component of Pharmaceutical Assistance)
Uses LLM to process and present this information in a more accessible way
Provides a user-friendly interface for patient consultations

### Initial Features

Automated scraping: Extract updated data from the government website
LLM processing: Organize and make information more understandable
Query interface: Allow patients to search for information about their conditions
Conditions list: Clearly present which clinical conditions are served by the pharmacy

### Technical Requirements

Language: Python
Features: Web scraping, LLM integration, web interface
Target: Website https://www.saude.df.gov.br/protocolos-clinicos-ter-resumos-e-formularios
Focus: Section "Condições Clínicas atendidas no Componente Especializado da Assistência Farmacêutica (CEAF)"

Additional Instructions

Prioritize usability and accessibility for patients
Implement robust error handling for scraping
Consider caching data to reduce requests to the official site
Document the code well and include clear installation instructions

Start by creating the basic project structure and the README.md as specified.

## Next Steps for Development

Update this CLAUDE.md file as the project structure and conventions are established.
